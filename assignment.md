# First Project - Data Analysis

This project is centered around exploratory data
analysis techniques and presentation of results to a client.


# The data

- I will use the King County Housing Data: This dataset contains information about home sales in King County (USA).
- I will find the data in the eda schema of our database. 
- I have used DBeaver to explore the data and do the necessary querrying and joining the table

# The Tasks

1. Create a new repo using this [template](hhttps://github.com/neuefische/ds-eda-project-template).

2. Through EDA/statistical analysis above please come up with **AT LEAST 3 insights** regarding the overall data. One should be geographical.

3. In addition also come up with **AT LEAST 3 recommendations** for your client.

_Note, you can take either the perspective of a buyer or a seller
